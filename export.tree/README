This dataset includes 8 sessions of medial prefrontal cortex continious rt-fmri biofeedback
for six patients with mild and moderate depression.
Each session consists of 2 runs. The first run contains 900 scans (TR=1 s.) with 15 blocks (60 s. duration). 
Each block includes 20 s. ROI down-regulation and 40 s of up-regulation.
The second run contains 600 scans (TR=1 s.) with 10 blocks (60 s. duration).
In odd sessions, both parts is neurofeedback, while in even sessions the second part is a transfer session, 
during which participants try to up- or downregulate the activity level of target area without feedback.
A changeable column is used for representation of ROI activity.
